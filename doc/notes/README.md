# Release Notes

This directory contains HTML forum post templates for EventRunner 6 releases.

## Contents

## Usage

These files are automatically generated by the release script (`scripts/create-release.sh`) and contain:

- Release highlights and changelog

Each HTML file can be opened in a browser and includes a one-click copy button for easy forum posting.

## Commit Message Tags

The release script automatically categorizes commits based on prefixes. Use these tags in your commit messages for proper release note formatting:

### Single-Tag Commits
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new device support for sensors"
git commit -m "fix: correct timezone handling in scheduler"
git commit -m "docs: add troubleshooting section to README"
git commit -m "refactor: optimize event processing pipeline"
git commit -m "test: add integration tests for MQTT client"
```

### Multi-Tag Commits
You can include multiple tagged changes in one commit by adding them in the body:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: implement sensor dashboard

fix: correct temperature conversion bug

```
